		<p><a href="http://www.johnholbrook.us/">John Holbrook</a>, a junior, has been involved with competetive robotics in some capacity since 2008, first by participating in the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">FIRST LEGO League</a>, then as a mentor for FLL teams, and now as part of BACKDRIVE. Outside of the world of VEX Robotics, John enjoys tinkering with the LEGO&reg; Mindstorms line of robots (particularly <a href="http://ev3dev.org">ev3dev</a> on the EV3), sailing, playing the viola, and tinkering with web design, including writing most of and administrating all of this site.</p>

<h2 id="hist">History</h2>
	<p>BACKDRIVE was first concieved in the fall of 2013, when Adam approched John about initiating what he termed a "robotics interest group." The two soon began meeting and attempted to design and build a robot to compete in the 2013-2014 VRC game, <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/wiki/Toss_Up">Toss Up</a>. However, neither of them really knew what they were doing, and the robot they built was simultaneousley over-ambitious and poorly excecuted. Having started late in the season and working to tight time constraints, they failed to have a functional robot ready in time for the state competition. The two resolved to regroup the following fall.</p>
	<p>In September of 2014 John and Adam, now joined by Alex, began design and construction of a new robot for use in the 2014-2015 VRC game, <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/wiki/Skyrise">Skyrise</a>. In January of 2015 the team <a href="http://www.robotevents.com/re-vrc-15-2400.html">attended their first tournament</a> in Parkersburg, WV. After ranking 2nd overall and allyng with the first-ranked and much more experienced team <a href="http://vex.us.nallen.me/teams/view/4112A">4112A</a>, the team, then known as "HighlandersRC," were named Tournament Champions and won the Sportsmanship award.</p>
	<p>The team attended their next tournament, the <a href="http://www.robotevents.com/re-vrc-15-2172.html">West Virginia State Championship</a>, in Fabruary of 2015. Unfortunately, a larger, more competitive tournament, combined with a somewhat unlucky qualification match pairing and some intermittent connectivity issues, meant that the team would be ranked 14th, and would captian the 8th seeded alliance, partnering with team <a href="http://vex.us.nallen.me/teams/view/1634B">1634B</a> and losing in the quarterfinals to the first seeded alliance consisting of <a href="http://vex.us.nallen.me/teams/view/6815B">6815B</a> and <a href="http://vex.us.nallen.me/teams/view/235">235</a>.</p>
	<p>Following the tournament, the team began to regroup and prepare for next season, including soliciting new members, choosing a proper team name and establishing a website, ordering additional parts (including pneumatics, an LCD, and mecanum wheels!), and building an experimental robot in order to become familiar with these parts.</p>
